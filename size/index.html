    <h1>You're in Love With a Psycho</h1>

            <p>You know it's the place I need
                But you got me walking circles like a dog on a lead
                The doctors say I'm crazy, that I'm eight miles thick
                I'm like the taste of Macaroni on a seafood stick
                You got me switched on baby, like electric Eel
                And I'm tight with Axel Foley, that's just how I feel
                Like a grapefruit and a magic trick
                The prodigal son
                I'm walking
                I'm walking
                I'm walking
                I walk so quick
                And it just don't mean a thing
                We've been waiting far too long
                We'll play it out again
                This is just my serenade
                You're in love with a Psycho
                You're in love with a Psycho
                And there's nothing you can do about it
                I got you running all around it
                You're in love with a Psycho
                You're in love with a Psycho
                And there's nothing you can do about it
                You're never gonna be without it
                Jibber-jabber at the bargain booze
                Reciting Charles Bukowski, I got nothing to lose
                And I wait for you to follow me, to share my chips
                But you're walking
                You're walking
                You walk
                You walk so quick
                Nobody's gonna take you there
                I stick around for the thousand yard stare
                I go to sleep in a duffle bag
                I'm never up, never down, down, down, down
                You're in love with a Psycho
                You're in love with a Psycho
                And there's just nothing you can do about it
                I got you running all around it
                You're in love with a Psycho
                You're in love with a Psycho
                And there's nothing you can do about it
                You never gonna be without it
                Maybe this will be the fine solution
                Maybe this way, we'll find a solution
                But we're far too lost, we gotta find love
                You're in love with a Psycho
                You're in love with a Psycho
                And there's nothing you can do about it
                I got you running all around it
                You're in love with a Psycho
                Tu amor es muy loco
                And there's nothing you can do about
                You're never gonna be without it</p>
