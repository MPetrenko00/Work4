            <h1>You're in Love With a Psycho</h1>
        <p>
            We've been waiting far too long
            We'll play it out again
            This is just my serenade
            You're in love with a Psycho
            You're in love with a Psycho
            And there's nothing you can do about it
            I got you running all around it
            You're in love with a Psycho
            You're in love with a Psycho
            And there's nothing you can do about it
            You're never gonna be without it
            Jibber-jabber at the bargain booze
            Reciting Charles Bukowski, I got nothing to lose
            And I wait for you to follow me, to share my chips
            But you're walking
            You're walking
            You walk
            You walk so quick
